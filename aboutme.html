      <h2>About Jericha</h2>
      <p>I am from New Ireland province, East New Britain province and Milne Bay and have two older siblings. I am currently taking the bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in User Experience at IBSU University.
        <br>
        I was born in 2003, as the youngest of three children. Growing up, I would be out playing in the morning till afternoon and if I wast I would be playing video games on my Gameboy like Zelda and Dragon Ball Z. I also took part in church items like skits and dances, mostly because that is where I met my best friend. I had experienced a unique childhood growing up and I am grateful because it has made me into the person I am today. I always strive to be my own authentic self and understand that there is not only one way to do something.
        <br> 
        I also spent time during my high school days playing netball, organizing school events and fundraisers. Although I did not continue playing sports, now that I am in university I am involved in my local churchâ€™s youth programs.
